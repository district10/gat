- Introduction: [gat intro][gat-intro]

- It will be hard and painful to learn. 

- I have some script to trans chinese to gat code, see [here][gat-trans]. e.g.

```
➜  scripts git:(master) ✗ ./gat-search.sh "你的就是我的，我的还是我的"
{你,too}{的,i}{就,ev}{是,a}{我,q}{的,i}{我,q}{的,i}{还,tcx}{是,a}{我,q}{的,i}
```

- And I made some [typing tutorials][tutorials]. (I need to get used it too~)

log: 
 - I already started it. See [Here][misc-gat]. 
 - I think this is done. I should put more time trying it.
